# quick little bio

Hey my name is Caleb Cifuentes and I am from a small town here in south west Missouri. I have grown up on a farm
where we raise and sell beef cattle. Some of my hobbies include playing ping pong, spike ball, and going to the gym.
Before this course I have learned some of java, python, and c++, but I have never done anything with Git or Github
so I am ready to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes.
